# QFN tuning dashboard

Updated 2026-11-04. **Keep this file at or below 15,000 UTF-8 bytes.** Replace
status entries in place; put experiment histories, commands, samples and failure
analysis in the linked tuning notes, not in this dashboard.

## Current status

**Earlier checkpoint `2cf99995d`:** finite-trajectory MTP comparison and full OpenCode
session complete on accepted ROCm TP4. [Contract and live MTP table](QFN_MTP_TP4_TUNING.md).
The A1 rates below are historical **MTP-off** results.

**QFN ROCm TP4: accepted Dynamic; fresh finite-trajectory timing complete.**
512/256 repetition: Dynamic **101.367 D**, Off **43.512**, fresh Castagna fixed6
**100.098**: **+1.267%** Dynamic/fork. All nine measured streams match using the
same 255-token decode denominator. Native ignores stop termination; the fork
permits EOS. This qualifies the observed finite trajectory, not identical EOS
semantics or general performance superiority. Speed 6/10 remains diagnostic.

The checkpoint's Unit/preflight, HTTP and ten-phase OpenCode evidence is
retained in the host note: 110 tools, zero errors, 95.1% prefix-token reuse,
clean retirement and owned-cache cleanup. It does not certify later changes
or the 29 hardware cases skipped at that checkpoint.
[Host diagnosis and receipts](QFN_HOST_REGISTRATION_INVALIDATION_20261028.md);
[controller plan](QFN_MTP_TARGET_CONFIRMATION_20261028.md).

[QSA][qsa], [GDN][gdn] and [online rescale][online-rescale] retain exact
logits; component savings do not establish model gain.

| Next action | State / decision |
|---|---|
| Admission | [Six-row target][target-matrix]: TP4 and genuine six-GPU follower RAM/SSD source controls each pass 2/2. Matched SSD TP2 passes 8/12; shared-pool continuation owners need native transport completion. Fresh RAM-backed ConsumerLocal controls pass 4/4. Complete regression collection is retained in the follow-up. The focused repair run now passes all 57 registrations, with no skips and clean native retirement/driver checks. Six TP4 cache source controls pass with clean driver/retirement checks. Four rebalancing source controls pass their cases, but two AMD user-pointer workqueue warnings keep that run unqualified. |
| Native lifetime | [Review](QFN_NATIVE_RESOURCE_ALLOWANCE_REVIEW_2026-11-01.md): r65 passes all four source controls, final retirement and driver checks. |
| Continuation / ngrams | [CPU1/CPU2 Static/RAM accuracy panels](../2026-11/QFN_CPU_EXPERT_TENSOR_SHARDING_QUALIFICATION.md) pass; CPU2 retains one approved KL exception (1.38264 ≤ 1.5), with aggregate limits unchanged. CPU2 fixed1/fixed3/dynamic MTP source admission and native byte-equivalence pass; dynamic covers three controller windows. Whole↔CPU2 staging/abort and source retirement pass, including actual FP32 CUDA/ROCm transfers. Both backends pass 20 invocations each for captured prefill, decode and grouped-verifier compute/rooted return/reset, including serial-row byte equivalence. Exact per-piece observations and the common context-bound MPI economy exchange pass 23 focused registrations, including empty/live payloads and distributed context retirement. **Open:** complete cohort service/migration pricing, publication/inference, shared native ngram owners beyond private TP2, Release economy and all six broad rows. [Scoped evidence](../2026-11/QFN_COHORT_MIGRATION_AND_MTP_ADMISSION_QUALIFICATION.md). Dynamic cohort execution is guarded. Complete67 remains red; focused passes do not certify full preflight. |

QSA temporal/page certificates did not repay their costs through **64K/128K**;
no pruning policy is installed. [Study][certificates]. CUDA hardware profiling
is paused after a profiler/driver assertion; native events remain available.

## Canonical functional and performance matrix

The current target is these **six hardware rows**, across RAM/SSD ngram backing
and bounded RAM/VRAM row caches with promotion/demotion. [Coverage plan][target-matrix]
owns the pairing strategy; the existing typed test definitions own commands.
Q6 tests ngram ownership on continuation GPUs, follower GPUs, and both. Its four
MI50s must execute real expert work. Any required CPU expert backing is explicit.

Rates are tok/s: prefill **P**, after-prefill decode **D**. ⚪ means the revised
cell is pending; **— means unmeasured, never zero**. Earlier measurements below
remain controls and do not qualify the new tier/ownership combinations.

| Row | Topology | Accuracy | Llaminar P | Reference P | Strata P | Llaminar D | Reference D | Strata D |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Q1 | 1× MI50 | ⚪ | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Q2 | 2× MI50 | ⚪ | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Q3 | 4× MI50 | ⚪ | — | — | — | — | — | — |

| Q6 | 2× RTX 3090 continuation + 4× MI50 followers | ⚪ | — | — | — | — | — | — |

Functional coverage retains MTP off/1/3/dynamic and dynamic expert balancing.
Small C0/C64 row-cache fixtures force movement; performance uses useful admitted
capacities and reports exact tier bytes, hit rates and working set. Current
native transfer floor: retained Release 22/28 green. Fresh original-owner
Integration runs pass all six RCCL cases and all six CUDA cases after native
stack provisioning; the original CUDA failure is reproduced by an isolated
control. Release timing and complete lookup/inference remain unqualified; no
transport default is promoted. Retained RCCL small-message event round trips
are about 48 µs versus mapped 65–66 µs.

### Earlier measured controls

C = Castagna Veloce; U = upstream llama.cpp because the pinned Castagna fork
does not build for SM86. ⚠ Upstream A3 decode spans12.293–17.417tok/s; placement
and repeatability still need closure. A2/A3 partition/mmap policies differ
between engines. Strata≈ uses the approved BF16 pack and default tail7 skipping
(about29.5% fewer expert contributions); it has no inherited accuracy badge.
Full top10 Strata controls are44.235P/19.750D on MI50 and73.508P/24.791D on3090.
[Baseline details][history]; [Strata distinctions][strata-history].

A1 uses `TensorParallel`, `GateUpOwnedDownColumns`, `VocabularySharded`,
Automatic Four-worker gate/up, shape-selected Q5 down, ValueMajor GDN and
FP16 Prefill8/Decode33 attention. Its fresh accepted Dynamic result is above.
Earlier alternative policies, CPU/PP controls and the superseded topology list
are preserved in the [target note][target-matrix], not expanded here.

## Accuracy and measurement contract

Mean final-logit KL is in nats; top-5 is mean set overlap divided by five.
Values below are **prefill / decode**. A1's current required short panel uses
16 frozen histories plus six forced decode steps; eight heldout histories and
reset replay also pass. All 185 rows, including diagnostic/reset rows, match
the accepted references. N2047/D9 remains diagnostic, not long-context certification.

| Accuracy slice | Mean KL | Top-1 | Top-5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A1 current / checkpoint196, short | 0.025614 / 0.028276 | 93.75% / 95.83% | 92.50% / 92.29% |
| A1 current, heldout-short | 0.014911 / 0.004553 | 100% / 100% | 95.00% / 91.67% |
| A2 G60 | 0.024628 / 0.032013 | 87.50% / 98.96% | 95.00% / 92.08% |
| A3 G60 | 0.023410 / 0.020687 | 81.25% / 97.92% | 93.75% / 91.88% |
| A4 G60 | 0.016063 / 0.022886 | 93.75% / 100% | 92.50% / 90.21% |
| A5 G60 | 0.032444 / 0.024587 | 93.75% / 97.92% | 90.00% / 90.21% |

**Matched A1 workload:** original four-shard `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL`,
512 prompt tokens, 256 emitted tokens (255 after-prefill steps), context4096,
FP16 KV, M512, greedy seed42, MTP/prefix cache off, unprofiled Release,
28 NUMA1 physical workers, one warmup and three measured iterations per lifecycle.
Arithmetic: HC-up TwoTermQ8, FP16 router operands with FP32 accumulation,
FP16 MoE alpha/beta and ordinary Q8 projection activations.

Every changed topology, precision, storage policy or context needs its own
accuracy/performance pair. Keep all samples and failed runs in linked evidence;
observe quiet-host, driver, retirement and token-equality checks. Use the
[canonical numerical gates][accuracy-plan] and layer/stage PyTorch CSVs for
diagnosis. A pooled mean or a component gain is insufficient for promotion.

Storage coverage includes RAM, SSD mmap, bounded/pool tiers and replicated/
sharded VRAM, with hot-row movement/reset. Priority is VRAM → RAM → SSD;
ngrams have lowest VRAM admission priority. The [qualification plan][plan]
owns full geometry, ownership and live-communication coverage.
